# Phishing_Web_Detection_Using_ML

Due to Phishing, many users waste their money and it costs users billions of dollars per
year. This luring techniques used by persons to fish for the personal data or information in a
pond of unsuspecting internet users. They usually use spoofed e-mail, and software to get the
personal information. They also get the confidential data like usernames and passwords. In this
project we analysis the attack of phishing of websites using various Machine Learning methods
like Decision tree, KNN. In this we train the models for the better understanding of the detection
and keeping various parameters like security IP into the consideration. This parameters helps us
to detect the phishing websites and find accurately.
